# Deep-Builder

This is a project built to replace the current Deepwoken builder.

Deepwoken is a popular RPG roblox game that was recognized as the 'Best New Experience' in 2022. This game has a large and dedicated fanbase that love to min-max their builds; the only issue is ,you have to either build something by hand, or just copy peoples builds from YouTube or Discord and risk running an out-dated , on-meta build. 

My goal here is to totally replace the current builder, and create a Reddit style builder in which users can vote and comment on this week/months best builds, keeping up with patches/nerfs/buffs as needed.
